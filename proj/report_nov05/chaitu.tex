Work Progress:
I have been looking at understanding BASE, which is a graphical interface to display the logs generated by the Snort IDS. I installed Snort, BASE and other related software on my Linux VM and have got these to work together. I had to make some adjustments to the Snort alert rules so that HTTP transactions show up in the BASE reports.

Going forward, we need to use Snort and BASE to build our whitelist of websites. As a next step, I will be looking at getting domain names from the IP addresses of the visited websites in the BASE reports.
