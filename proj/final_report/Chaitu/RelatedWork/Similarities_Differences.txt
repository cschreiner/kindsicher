1) Cherry D. - The Basics of Digital: Privacy Simple Tools to Protect your Personal Information and Your Identity Online - 2014
- Summary: The book discusses general self-protection principles for online browsing and communicating.
- Similarities: The book explains in some detail the reasons why children need online protection until they are grown-up enough to make good privacy and security judgments on their own.
- Differences: This does not talk about the technique of filtering and approving web traffic, which is the focus of this project.

2) Ivanovic I. - Distribution of web traffic toward the centralized cloud firewall system - RoEduNet International Conference 12th Edition - 2013
- Summary: The article is about how an access-list based firewalling system can became overwhelmed when the number of people on the Internet at the sponsoring educational institutions exploded, and how the administrators devised a workable replacement
- Similarities: We are building an access-list based firewalling system, which is similar to the system described in the paper.
- Differences: We do not expect to have anywhere near as many (thousands) of users as the educational institutions mentioned in this article.

3) Holloway D., Green L. and Livingstone S. - Zero to eight. Young children and their internet use - LSE, London: EU Kids Online - 2013
Risks and safety on the internet: the UK report - Livingstone, S., Haddon, L., Gorzig, A. and Olafsson, K. (2011) LSE, London: EU Kids Online
- Summary: These two articles are studies that show how children, in two age groups - 8 and under, and 9 to 16, use technology and more specifically, the Internet. They cover the type of activities children perform on the Internet and the potential harm they can be exposed to. They also give some guidelines on how children should be allowed to use the Internet to promote safety and balance.
- Similarities: These works look at Internet usage behavior in children with the intent of protecting them from harm by raising awareness. We are building a filtering system that is specifically designed for young children. It is important to know how children use the Internet so that we can build a system that works well for them.
- Differences: These works only focuses on usage and gives some recommendations. These are about effects and risks that the Internet can have on children. In our work, we are building a system. We are concerned about giving children a good experience while remaining safe on the Internet.

4) Nguyen H., Torrano-Gimenez C., Alvarez G., Franke K. and Petrović S.- Enhancing the effectiveness of Web Application Firewalls by generic feature selection - Conference on Computational Intelligence in Security for Information Systems - 2012
- Summary: The article is on how to improve the effectiveness of firewalls that are aware of individual web applications.
- Similarities: We are also building a web firewall of sorts.
- Differences: This focuses on automatically identifying web applications. We are interested in manually identifying websites, not necessarily the applications running under them.

5) Han W., Cao Y., Bertino E. and Yong J. - Using automated individual white-list to protect web digital identities - Export Systems with Applications - 2012
- Summary: This provides an example of successfully using whitelists, with means of quickly updating the whitelist.  It shows the basic feasibility of whitelisting in select circumstances, and demonstrates the need to easily update the whitelist.
- Similarities: The article uses a whitelist technique for internet safety.
- Differences: The article focuses on general anti-phishing and anti-name-spoofing, we are focusing on controlling what websites children visit.

6) Baykan E., Henzinger M., Marian L. and Weber I. - A Comprehensive Study of Features and Algorithms for URL-Based Topic Classification - ACM Transactions on the Web - 2011
- Summary: This presents interesting means of classifying a page by its URL and URLs of pages that link to it. This maybe useful for classifying pages to make a recommendation for parental approval/rejection.
- Similarities: The article classifies webpages by their URLs, so are we.
- Differences: The article automatically classifies webpages into many subject-matter-based categories; we classify into two categories: allowed and forbidden.

7) Iha, G. and Doi, H. - An Implementation of the Binding Mechanism in the Web Browser for Preventing XSS Attacks: Introducing the Bind-Value Headers - International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security - 2009
- Summary: This paper notes that the hard part of using a whitelist is defining the whitelist.
- Similarities: The article discusses a whitelist, and we are using a whitelist.
- Differences: The article focuses on preventing XSS attacks, we are focused on filtering Internet available to a family's children.

8) Livingstone S. and Helsper, E. J. - Parental Mediation of Children's Internet Use - Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, Volume 52, Issue 4 - 2008
- Summary: In this paper, the author’s performed a survey of parents and children to measure the use of the Internet by children. They look at how parents were able to control children’s use of the Internet and if it was effective or not.
- Similarities: This work is similar to our work in that we are they discuss how filtering Internet usage positively and negatively affected children and we are building a filter for families. It is important to know what is good and bad about filtering to see if we can make a better design.
- Differences: The work done in the paper is more focused on social aspects of filtering whereas we are more concerned about the technical challenges of designing a good system.

9) Chen Z., Wu O., Zhu M. and Hu W. - A Novel Web Page Filtering System by Combining Texts and Images - IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence - 2006
- Summary: This paper presents interesting means of combining text and graphical data to detect pornography and shows the complexity needed for good automatic classification.
- Similarities: Article discusses an algorithm for automatically classifying webpages to protect users against unwanted sexual content; we are also trying to protect users against unwanted sexual content.
- Differences: Article focuses on automatic techniques to classify webpages, we rely on a human-generated whitelist.  The article focuses on sexual content, we focus on any content the parents consider objectionable. (For example, parents might decide not to approve a site merely for best-use-of-time concerns.)

10) Ybarra, M. L. and Mitchell, K. J. - Exposure to Internet pornography among children and adolescents: A national survey - CyberPsychology & Behavior - 2005
- Summary: This paper is a study of the exposure of children and teenagers to pornography. It also looks at the effects of having easy access to pornography has on children's lives.
- Similarities: As we are building our system, it is important to understand the behavior of children using the Internet. We need to make sure that our system fits the behaviors of the children that use the Internet today.
- Differences: This paper is just a study and a survey of behavior while our system is actually going to be used by children.

11) Ho, W.H.and Watters, P.A. - Statistical and Structural Approaches to Filtering Internet Pornography - IEEE Internal Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics - 2004
- Summary: This paper also notes that hard part of whitelisting is building the whitelist. This also has an interesting description of a Bayesian classification algorithm.
- Similarities: Article discusses whitelisting, which is a technique we are using.
- Differences: Article focuses on techniques to substitute for whitelisting, while we are using whitelisting as our primary technique.

12) Watson, P. - Slipping in the Window: TCP Reset attacks - CanSecWest 2004 Security Conference - 2004
- Summary: This paper is looking at TCP reset attacks. A TCP reset attack is when a third party inserts a TCP reset into a TCP stream. This causes both ends of the TCP connection to close the TCP socket. The paper discusses TCP reset attacks and how to prevent them.
- Similarities: We are planning on using a TCP reset to stop a connection to a blacklisted website. It is the mechanism by which we block website access. It is important for us to know if a TCP reset can be prevented or not.
- Differences: The paper's work is purely about TCP resets whereas we are using TCP resets for a specific purpose.
