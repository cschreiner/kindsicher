\section{Conclusion}

We present a system called Kindsicher that provides an unique approach to
protecting children from the potential harms of the Internet. Our system has
two major goals: block all access to websites, except for sites that are on a
white list, and provide insight into how families are using the Internet through
reporting. We describe each of the components to our system and how they fit
together.

Over the course of designing the system, we found that building such a system
is much harder than first assumed.  
%
Our team has previous experience successfully building a similar system, but
the combination of today's internet speeds, today's hardware optimizations,
and today's system software has significantly changed the implementation
challenges.
%
The Internet is a complex place which makes it currently hard to build a
system like this that is robust enough to withstand real usage.
%
At the same time, that very complexity makes it ever so much more
important for children to learn to handle the advantages and risks that
the Internet offers.  A fully functional system implementing the principles of
Kindsicher would be a useful tool to help parents teach their children how to
deal with them.
