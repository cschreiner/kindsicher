\section{Conclusion}

We present a system called Kindsicher that provides an unique approach to
protecting children from the potential harms of the Internet. Our system has
two major goals: block all access to websites, except for sites that are on a
white list and provide insight into how families are using the Internet through
reporting. We describe each of the components to our system and how they fit
together.

Over the course of designing the system, we found that building such a system
is much harder than first assumed. The Internet is a complex place which makes
it hard to build a system like this that is robust enough to withstand real
usage. At the same time, that very complexity makes it ever so much
more important for children to learn how to handle the advantages and risks
that the Internet offers.  A fully functional Kindsicher system would be a
useful tool to help parents teach their children how to deal with it.
