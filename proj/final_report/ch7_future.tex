\section{Future Work}

As described in section~\ref{blocking}, we encountered some latency issues with
SNORT that inhibited its blocking ability under certain conditions. For

In the Reporting section, we described some of the shortcomings of BASE,
primary of which being its reporting on network access using only IP addresses.
The reporting can be made more user friendly by incorporating domain names

a richer set of data to parents, that makes understanding their child's web
access footprint much more intuitive.

Over the longer term, we also need a process that automates maintaining the
addresses in the SNORT white-list. We envision that a child can request
addition of a new website domain as a text message to the parent's phone and
the parent could then chose to approve or deny that request, automatically
updating the white-list as needed.
